Repository containing data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.

### Machine Learning
  - [Machine Learning Explainer Dashboard](https://machine-learn-ex.herokuapp.com/): A dashboard to interpret machine learning models and tuning of hyperparameters. Interactive features provides to visualize the effect of hyperparmaters and make machine learning easier. 
  - [Classification: Detecting Diabetic in Early Stage](https://github.com/myothida/diabetic-detection-app.git): A model to detect the Diabetic using different features such as Age, weight, height and blood pressure. A total of six different classification algorithms are used to evaluate the performance of the model. 
  - [Regression: Predicting Bhutan Traffic Offences](Link): A model to predict the number of traffic offences using various features..
  - [Regression: Predicting Car Prices](Link): A model to predict the value of a second hand car in using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their car utilizing machine learning.

### Data Analysis and Visualisation
  - [Student Performance Data Analysis](https://da-grade-bhutan.herokuapp.com/): Dashboard for visualizing the performance of the students (Bhutan - Data Analytic Class 2021-2022). 
  - [Explorary Analysis : State of the Art Technology](https://github.com/myothida/survey_dashboard.git): Explorary Analysis on the sate-of-the-art technologies in Data Science (Kaggle data-set : Data Science Survey 2019).
  - [Diagnostic Analytics : Traffic Offences Analysis](https://github.com/myothida/repeated_offences.git): In-depth data analysis, extracting insights and reporting to measure the cuases behind the increased number of traffic offences.
