Repository containing data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.

### Machine Learning
  - [Machine Learning Explainer Dashboard](https://machine-learn-ex.herokuapp.com/): A dashboard to interpret machine learning models and tuning of hyperparameters. Interactive features provides to visualize the effect of hyperparmaters and make machine learning easier. 
  - [Classification: Detecting Diabetic : Model Developing](https://github.com/myothida/diabetic-detection-app.git): Develop ML model to detect diabetic using different features. Two data-sets (Well-known Pima Indians Diabetes Database and new data set that combined both Behaviour-based features and demographic features such as age, weight, height and blood pressure. 
  - [Classification: Detecting Diabetic Web-app: Deployed Model](https://ml-diabetic-detect.herokuapp.com/): A model to detect the Diabetic using different features such as Age, weight, height and blood pressure and behaivour features such as smoking, drinking and regular exercises. 
  - [Regression: Predicting Housing Price](Link): A model to predict the housing price (residential homes in Boston Housing dataset) using various features..Advanced regression techniques (random forest and gradient boosting) are deployed to predict the housing price. 
  - [Regression: Predicting Number of Deceased](Link): A model to predict the number of decased in Myanmar. 
### Data Analysis and Visualisation
  - [Traffic Violation Analysis](https://github.com/myothida/TrafficViolationAnalysis.git): This project analyse the traffic violation data and visualize the insight. 
  - [Student Performance Data Analysis](https://da-grade-bhutan.herokuapp.com/): Dashboard for visualizing the performance of the students (Bhutan - Data Analytic Class 2021-2022). 
  - [Explorary Analysis : State of the Art Technology](https://github.com/myothida/survey_dashboard.git): Explorary Analysis on the sate-of-the-art technologies in Data Science (Kaggle data-set : Data Science Survey 2019).
  - [Diagnostic Analytics : Analysis on the situation of Myanmar](link) In-depth data analysis, extracting insights and reporting to measure the cuases behind the increased number of deceased. 

### Teaching Aids
- [Python Programming](https://github.com/myothida/PythonProgramming.git): This repo includes the assignments and lectures conducted in the Python Programming Course. This Course teaches you programming in general as well as Python fundamentals for data science. This course provides you knowledge and skills to create basic programs to work with real data and solve real-world problems in Python. You will gain a strong foundation for more advanced learning that requires the Python Programming knowledge.
